  *BMCs* are a fundamental component of datacenter bare metal assets like servers and chassis,  

  The bmc-toolbox leverages the _Baseboard Management Controller_ to help manage the lifecycle of datacenter bare metal assets  

  It provides tools to **inventorize**, **configure**, **manage**, **authenticate/authorize** a large fleet of bare metal assets through the BMC.


- *bmclib* - A Go lang library that provides a consistent set of methods to interface with BMCs.
- *dora* - tool to **inventorize** a fleet of bare metal servers and chassis assets.
- *bmcbutler* - tool to handle **configuration management**  for a fleet of bare metal server and chassis BMCs.
- *actor* - A single **API webservice** endpoint to interact with a fleet of bare metal BMCs.
- *bmcldap* - LDAP based **authentication/authorization** service/proxy for BMCs.
- *bmcfwupd* - tool to **update** the BMC firmware.
