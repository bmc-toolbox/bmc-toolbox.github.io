### How does bmc-toolbox differ from Redfish?


The bmc-toolbox provides a client library (bmclib) and a set of tools to manage and interact with BMCs,  
while Redfish is guiding standard managed by the DMTF for a consistent interface to BMCs,  
bmc-toolbox leverages this Redfish service for its toolset.
